## üìå Purpose

This document serves as a collaborative space for the GitMesh community to propose and discuss gamification features. Your ideas will help shape how we motivate contributors, recognize achievements, and build a more engaging open source experience.

As mentioned in our [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md), we're planning to implement a **Gamification & Achievement System** where contributors can earn points, badges, and level-ups for various activities. This document helps us collect and organize your innovative ideas!
