# GitMesh Community Edition — Release Process

Version 0.3 — Community Edition
Last Updated: 1 December 2025

GitMesh Community Edition (CE) is a standalone open source project under the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT). GitMesh CE correlates market signals with engineering telemetry to auto-generate ranked backlogs, sprint plans, and work routing, fully synced across your dev stack.

The release process exists to move CE closer to that goal on every iteration: better backlog intelligence, smoother workflows, and a more reliable experience for the people who use it. This document describes how changes become official CE releases and how roles participate in that flow. It applies only to GitMesh CE, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. GitMesh Enterprise Edition (EE) is proprietary to Alveoli and is not governed by this process.

CE governance defines how people fit into releases. Newbie Contributors submit early fixes and documentation. Active Contributors ship features and bug fixes regularly. Core Contributors review and maintain key subsystems. Principal Contributors provide long-term technical direction and help shape releases. CE Maintainers coordinate the overall process, decide when to cut a release, and ensure quality, security, and a clean separation from EE.

A release starts with contributions to the CE repository. Contributors open pull requests against the main CE branch, following contribution guidelines, tests, and documentation requirements. Changes must be compatible with the Apache License 2.0 and must not include or depend on proprietary GitMesh EE code. Active and Core Contributors review for correctness, performance, and impact on users and workflows. Principal Contributors and CE Maintainers review higher-impact changes, especially those that affect how market signals, telemetry, or routing logic behave. Only after adequate review and agreement is a change merged into the main development branch.

Maintainers decide to cut a release when there is a meaningful set of changes that improve backlog quality, routing accuracy, developer experience, or general stability. There is no rigid calendar; releases are driven by practical improvements to how GitMesh CE helps teams plan and execute work. Before finalizing a release, maintainers may temporarily freeze new features and focus on stabilization: fixing regressions, improving tests, tightening documentation, and clarifying any upgrade or migration steps.

Security is always checked before a release. Maintainers and Principal Contributors review changes touching authentication, authorization, storage, networking, data flows, and integrations with the rest of the dev stack. They verify that no high-impact vulnerabilities are introduced or left unresolved and that third-party dependencies are in a reasonable state. Security issues specific to CE are handled privately according to the CE security policy and reported to the Lab Leader. Security issues related to EE are handled separately by Alveoli and are outside this process. If a serious vulnerability is discovered, maintainers may publish a focused security release with minimal changes purely to protect users.

When the release content is stable, a CE Maintainer creates a release commit and tags it with a version that clearly indicates the size of change (patch, minor, major). From this tag, the project builds and publishes artifacts such as source archives or images. All artifacts produced under this process are GitMesh Community Edition only and are licensed under Apache License 2.0. No proprietary EE code may appear in CE tags, branches, or release packages.

Each release is accompanied by concise release notes. These notes summarize new features, backlog and routing improvements, bug fixes, and important behavioral or configuration changes. They also mention any user-visible security fixes and known issues affecting upgrades. Where relevant, release notes can highlight changes in contributor roles, such as new Core or Principal Contributors, with the canonical record in `governance/contributors.yaml`.

If a previously merged change turns out to be unstable, incomplete, or not ready for real users, maintainers may revert or postpone it to protect release quality. Reasons are recorded in the issue or governance tracker, and contributors are informed. These decisions are made to protect the GitMesh user experience and do not automatically affect contributor roles, though consistent patterns of low-quality or irresponsible changes may be considered under governance rules.

When a critical regression or serious security issue is found in an existing release, maintainers may create an emergency or security-only release. This focuses on the smallest safe fix, rapid validation, and clear communication about impact and recommended upgrades. Emergency releases remain bound by the security policy, Code of Conduct, and governance rules, and they remain strictly CE-only.

Conflicts related to release content or decisions are handled through CE governance. Contributors who disagree with a release decision can open an issue in the governance tracker and request review by CE Maintainers. If necessary, matters can be escalated to the Governance Council as described in the governance document. All discussions must follow the Code of Conduct; harassment, personal attacks, or attempts to pressure maintainers are unacceptable and may result in role restrictions or removal.

The release process itself is expected to evolve. GitMesh CE exists to solve concrete planning and collaboration problems, and the process must stay lightweight and pragmatic. Changes to this document are made through pull requests in the CE repository, with CE Maintainers recording final decisions. Feedback from all contributor roles is welcome so that the release process stays focused on what matters most: delivering a better GitMesh experience for everyone who relies on Community Edition.
