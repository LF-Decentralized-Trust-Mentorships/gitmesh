GitMesh Code of Conduct
Version 0.3 – GitMesh Community Edition
Last Updated: 1 December 2025

---

The GitMesh community, under the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT), is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all participants. All community members, contributors, maintainers, and leaders, including the Lab Leader, agree to uphold this Code of Conduct in every interaction related to GitMesh.

The community is open to individuals of all ages, body sizes, visible and invisible disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, personal appearances, races, castes, colors, religions, and sexual identities and orientations. No form of harassment, exclusion, or discrimination based on these or any other characteristics is acceptable.

All participants are expected to act in a way that fosters an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive environment. Members should treat one another with empathy, kindness, and respect. Differing viewpoints and experiences are to be engaged with constructively and professionally. Constructive feedback should be given thoughtfully and received graciously. Participants are encouraged to acknowledge their mistakes, take responsibility for them, and learn from such experiences. At all times, the collective interests and health of the GitMesh community and the broader LFDT ecosystem should take precedence over individual preferences.

The community expects courteous and professional communication in all forums and channels associated with GitMesh. Members should use inclusive and appropriate language, remain focused on discussions that further project goals, and support others by offering assistance or asking for help when needed. The time, effort, and contributions of all participants must be respected. Community interactions, whether written or verbal, should reflect the professional and collaborative nature of an open source project under LFDT.

Collaboration within the project requires acknowledging and properly crediting the work and ideas of others, sharing knowledge and resources openly, and being patient and welcoming toward newcomers. Professional relationships within the community should be grounded in mutual respect and constructive dialogue. Conflicts should be resolved through calm discussion and, when necessary, by following established project and LFDT processes. Decisions made through the project’s governance structures and LFDT’s policies are to be respected, even when individuals disagree with them.

All participants are expected to uphold high standards of technical conduct. Contributions must be made honestly and accurately, with appropriate testing, documentation, and adherence to established coding standards and best practices. Intellectual property rights and licensing obligations must be respected without exception. Any discovered security vulnerabilities must be reported through responsible disclosure processes defined by the project. Contributors should support the project’s technical roadmap and LFDT’s broader mission to advance decentralized trust technologies.

Certain behaviors are strictly unacceptable in the GitMesh community. These include any form of harassment, intimidation, or discrimination; the use of sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances; trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; disruptive behavior in community spaces; and any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. Publishing or sharing private information about others, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission is prohibited. Misrepresentation of affiliation with LFDT, GitMesh, or Alveoli is likewise unacceptable, as is any violation of third-party intellectual property rights.

This Code of Conduct applies in all GitMesh community spaces, both online and offline. It also applies whenever an individual is representing the project or LFDT in any public context, including use of official email addresses, social media accounts, participation in LFDT and GitMesh events, and any GitMesh-branded communications or presentations. The scope of this Code of Conduct extends to behavior outside of official channels where such behavior has a reasonable likelihood of negatively affecting the safety, well-being, or participation of GitMesh community members.

Any person who experiences or witnesses behavior that may violate this Code of Conduct is encouraged to report it. Reports may be submitted to the Lab Leader at [rawx18.dev@gmail.com](mailto:rawx18.dev@gmail.com) or to the LFDT Code of Conduct Committee at [support@lfdecentralizedtrust.org](mailto:support@lfdecentralizedtrust.org). All reports will be handled with discretion and respect for the privacy of the reporter. When making a report, it is helpful, though not required, to provide contact information, the names of individuals involved (if known), a detailed description of the incident and its context, any relevant documentation or evidence, an indication of whether the incident is ongoing, and information about any related prior incidents.

Reports will be acknowledged in a timely manner. Community leaders and LFDT representatives will conduct an initial assessment to determine the appropriate response team and process. A fair and thorough investigation will follow, and a decision will be made regarding appropriate actions or consequences. These actions may range from a private warning to a temporary or permanent ban from community participation, depending on the severity and pattern of behavior. After a decision is made, the necessary actions will be implemented, and, where appropriate, follow-up steps will be taken to ensure the situation is resolved and the community remains safe and healthy.

In enforcing this Code of Conduct, community leaders will consider the impact of the behavior on the community. Minor or first-time violations that involve unprofessional or inappropriate language or conduct may result in a private written warning and, where appropriate, a request for an apology. More serious or repeated violations may lead to a formal warning with specific conditions on further interaction. Serious breaches of community standards or sustained inappropriate behavior may lead to a temporary ban from any form of interaction or participation in GitMesh community spaces. Repeated, severe, or targeted harassment, or conduct demonstrating ongoing hostility toward individuals or protected classes, may result in a permanent ban from all community activities.

Any individual who believes they have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct may appeal the decision. Appeals should be directed, in the first instance, to the project maintainers via [rawx18.dev@gmail.com](mailto:rawx18.dev@gmail.com), with a detailed explanation of the grievance and any supporting information. If necessary, the matter may be escalated to the LFDT Code of Conduct Committee at [support@lfdecentralizedtrust.org](mailto:support@lfdecentralizedtrust.org). Appeals will be reviewed fairly and promptly, and decisions will be communicated in writing in accordance with LFDT’s established procedures.

GitMesh operates under the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust and aligns with LFDT’s charter, bylaws, and governance principles. The project is committed to open source values such as transparency, collaboration, and open development; to advancing decentralized trust technologies in a responsible and innovative way; and to fostering diversity, inclusion, and technical excellence across all aspects of the community.

GitMesh is distributed in multiple editions. GitMesh Community Edition (CE) is made available under the Apache License 2.0. Members of the community are free to use GitMesh CE under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, subject to full compliance with that license’s conditions, including proper attribution and respect for all third-party licenses. GitMesh CE is intended to support open collaboration, experimentation, and adoption in alignment with LFDT’s mission.

GitMesh Enterprise Edition (EE) is distinct from GitMesh CE and is the exclusive property of Alveoli. It is not open source and is not intended for unrestricted public use. GitMesh EE, including all associated documentation, is proprietary software that may only be used in accordance with the GitMesh Subscription Terms of Service or another written agreement governing use of the Enterprise Edition. Production use of GitMesh EE is permitted only for entities and individuals who maintain an active subscription for the appropriate number of user seats or tier, including, as applicable, Essential, Signals, Scale, or Enterprise tiers. Any production use of GitMesh EE without an active, valid subscription is strictly prohibited.

GitMesh EE may not be modified, adapted, reverse engineered, translated, or altered in any form, nor may derivative works of any kind be created from it. The rights granted to subscribers are strictly limited to the use of the unmodified software as provided, and only as expressly permitted in the applicable subscription agreement. All rights, title, and interest in and to GitMesh EE, including all intellectual property rights, remain exclusively with Alveoli. No rights are granted beyond those specifically stated in the governing license or contract.

The proprietary nature of GitMesh EE extends to all components that are not distributed as part of GitMesh CE. Components that belong to CE are licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and are usable solely for purposes consistent with that license. The CE license does not, under any circumstances, grant permission to use, access, modify, copy, or distribute any Enterprise Edition component. If any portion of GitMesh EE code is ever inadvertently included in or distributed with GitMesh CE, that code remains proprietary to Alveoli and must not be used, executed, copied, modified, incorporated, or redistributed. Any such discovery should be reported immediately and directly to an Alveoli founding member. All recipients are obliged to remove the inadvertently included Enterprise Edition material from all systems, repositories, forks, mirrors, backups, and distributions once it is discovered. The accidental presence of Enterprise Edition code in any CE repository or distribution does not confer any license, right, or authorization to use such code in any way.

GitMesh EE, like most software, is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. All third-party components incorporated into GitMesh CE or EE remain subject to their respective licenses and intellectual property terms.

This Code of Conduct and the related licensing statements may be updated over time to reflect changes in LFDT policies, project governance, legal requirements, community feedback, and evolving best practices in open source and hybrid licensing models. When material changes are made, contributors and users will be informed through the project’s communication channels, LFDT announcements, the GitMesh repository, and community meetings or forums, as appropriate.

By participating in the GitMesh project in any capacity, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct, respect the licensing terms applicable to GitMesh Community Edition and GitMesh Enterprise Edition, and support the broader mission of advancing decentralized trust technologies in collaboration with the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust and Alveoli.
